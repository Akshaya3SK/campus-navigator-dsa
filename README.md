#  Campus Navigator – DSA Mini Project

This is a C-based Campus Navigation system that simulates a real-world campus map using **Graph Data Structures**. It allows users to explore various locations, find shortest and alternate paths, and dynamically add new connections — all while showcasing core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 **All Possible Paths** using DFS
- 🛣️ **Shortest Path Finder** using DFS and Dijkstra's algorithm
- 🌉 **Minimum Spanning Tree** (Prim’s algorithm)
- 📚 **Search History Tracking** using Binary Search Tree
- 🔁 **Path with Intermediate Stops** support
- 🧭 **Topological Sort**
- ➕ **Add New Paths Dynamically** using Queue
- 🧱 Built using **Stacks**, **Queues**, **Graphs**, and **Trees**
